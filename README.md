## Abstract:
Accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is crucial for effective breast cancer treatment planning and improved patient outcomes. Traditional needle biopsies, limited in tissue sampling, often lead to inaccurate assessments due to intratumoral heterogeneity. To address this, we introduce the HER2 Multimodal Alignment and Prediction (MAP) model, which leverages pre-treatment multimodal breast cancer images for a more comprehensive reflection of tumor characteristics, thereby providing more accurate HER2 status prediction. We also develop patient response MAP models to compare the performance of HER2 prediction using our model with that of needle biopsy in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. A large-scale multimodal breast cancer dataset from four centers, consisting of 14,472 images from 6,991 cases, is adopted in this study, and the results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our HER2 MAP model in predicting patient response. These findings highlight the substantial advantages of our HER2 predictions. Our study provides physicians with a crucial tool for informed clinical decisions and treatment plans, aiming to improve outcomes in breast cancer patients.
